## What kinds of research could people do using the information in Hansard as a resource?
There are the official report of all Parliamentary debates in Hansard. Researchers can find members, their contributions, debates, petitions and divisions from 
published Hansard reports dating back over 200 years. 
At the same time, daily debates from Hansard are published on this website the next working day. 
Therefore, researchers can use the information in Hansard as a resource to study the historical development of the British Parliament, the evolution of its 
composition and powers, the legislative and judicial functions, the content of important meetings, the succession of monarchs, the positions of the House of Lords 
and the House of Commons.


## How well does the Hansard website facilitate those kinds of research?
In my opinion, the Hansard website facilitate those kinds of resaerch well.
Fristly, from the perspective of content, the website record the official report of all Parliamentary debates timely. The researchers can search for the latest news from the Parliament.
They also can trace back to the information in the past.
Secondly, from the layout of this website, its layout is very clear, with the Lords and Commons records set in distinct colours on the left and right sides of the 
page. Moreover, the link of Browse settings, Find debates, Find divisions and Find MPs are clearly sorted and it is very easy to find what the researchers want.
Thindly, from the user experience, in addition to clear categorised links, there is an overall search box. Researchers can search by key words and member name, which 
is veryquickly to get the target infomation page. Also, a smooth way to open pages and the clear design of the website facilitate the research much easier 
and give them good experience.
